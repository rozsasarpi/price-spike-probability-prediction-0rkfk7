"""
Unit tests package for the ERCOT RTLMP spike prediction system.

This package contains unit tests for individual components and functions
of the ERCOT RTLMP spike prediction system. The tests in this package
focus on testing isolated functionality with mocked dependencies.

This file is intentionally minimal as it primarily serves to mark the
directory as a Python package, enabling proper test discovery and
organization for pytest.
